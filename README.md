This confusion matrix describes the current performance of the classification model on the set of test data used for which the true values are known. It compares the actual target values with those predicted by the machine learning model. This matrix is in the format as shown:

[True Negative] [False Positive]

[False Negative] [True Positive]

True Negatives: The number of correct predictions that an instance is negative (non-fraudulent transactions in this case). Here, it is 56,854.

False Positives: The number of incorrect predictions that an instance is positive (legitimate transactions that were incorrectly identified as fraudulent). Here, it is 10.

False Negatives: The number of incorrect predictions where an instance is negative (fraudulent transactions that were not detected by the model). Here, it is 43.

True Positives: The number of correct predictions that an instance is positive (fraudulent transactions correctly identified). Here, it is 55.
